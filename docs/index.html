          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is not 
          included on this website due to my privacy concerns as I am currently in the process of scrubbing as much as I can from
          the internet and it felt scary to add to the search results. But there's still plenty I can say about myself,
          I am a woman, and I like to consider myself a person as well. I worry my identity as a woman might conflict with my 
          identity as a person but I'll get into that in the opinions section. I'm like if one consiousness experiencing itself subjectively was a linguistics major. Language, consiousness, and 
          subjectivity will be explored in the "Buy My Course" section. To the people who have met me, I am known as the most annoying 
          woman they will ever have had the privilege of speaking to, more on this in the contact section.
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a deeply troubled woman, I am constantly reflecting on pasts that 
          never happened, and the futures that they'll never make. Its called OCD, it gives you psychic powers and 
          they put me on Prozac for it. I am driven mad by the tragedies I inherited at birth, by the ghost of the woman my mother 
          deserved to be.

        <p id="txt" style="display: flex"><img src=".\oplia.jpg" alt="Ophelia by Henrietta Rae"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My identity as a woman
        conflicts with my idenity as a person in a world where women are not people but I wear it anyway. To be clear, I am only a woman
        for the glory and the profit, for the discounts and the handouts, for the love of the game, & to understand this painting.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This work is titled "Ophelia," in reference to the Hamlet character, it's old, painted by Henrietta Rae in 1890.
        Rae did an incredible job depicting Ophelia as her own entity, seperate from Hamlet. Her story was a tragedy in its own right,
        Hamlet was her Claudius, but she did not play his Hamlet. But if you were to look up "Ophelia Painting" the search results would show you Millais'
        "Ophelia" which was incredibly influential and is to this day far more famous than the work I included here, which is tragic because
        Millais' version is worse. He depicted the aftermath of Ophelia's suicide. Painting her corpse weak, helpless, and beautiful without even depicting Hamlet her story is still about Hamlet.
        Both of these paintings are named "Ophelia" but one was named for the woman and the other for the plot device.

        "Speaking thus is not merely 
        speaking, but acting, in that I turn to the imagination, which is the generator of an actuality, 
        so I am the sustainer or destroyer." - I said this in regards to speech acts independently of Hegel, coincidence is a wild thing.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very fond of the idea that words can create reality, obviously it is important to distill everything from me to you & you to me. 
        Even if I say something you won’t truly know what I’m thinking. I can only give you the approximation of my 
        thoughts, and the same is true vice-versa, I think art is also this way. Where no matter what we have this aloneness 
        that’s driven by the inherent isolation of consciousness, but I don’t think it has to be bad I think it just reflects
        the beauty of how we are always trying to achieve this impossible goal, and we do good enough to connect, to bridge our
        experiences as far as we can, but I think it means that sometimes we try to adapt to the way we think other people might 
        understand. Art can sometimes get caught here, called disingenuous, but I don't look at art that way, I see art as communication before I see it as anything else.
